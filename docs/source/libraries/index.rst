Libraries
=========

To save space and compile time, some specialist libraries are not included in the default configuration for builds of CODAL, and need to be
added to the project before the features they contain can be used.

Technically any valid URL can be used for a repository and CODAL will happily pull it into the project, but normally Github_ repositories are
where they are stored, as the rest of CODAL also uses Github_ natively.

.. note::
   If you know of other CODAL libraries, written by the community, or are the author of one yourself, use the `Github Issues`_ page for this
   documentation to let us know what we've missed, or submit a push request by forking `This Documentation`_ repository and adding to these
   pages.

   Thanks!
